# Cloud Resume Api ‚òÅÔ∏è

This repo contains my solution for [cloud resume api](https://cloudresumeapi.dev) challenge using AWS Cloud and Google Cloud Platform.

## ü•á AWS Cloud Solution

### Technologies/Services üöÄ

- Web server: Node.js
- Serverless Service: AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions
- Database: AWS Dynamo DB, GCP Cloud Firestore
- Nodejs version: v20.14.0 LTS
- CI: Github Actions

### Architecture and steps to complete the task

- The way I implemented the solution for this challenge is by setting up an HTTP API using API Gateway which will trigger the Lambda function to get the data from Dynamo DB.
- We have to create an IAM Lambda execution role and attach it to the lambda function which allows our function runtime to interact with Dynamo DB to the get the data.
- Users can access the API Gateway endpoint(https) deployment link which will trigger the lambda function to get the resume data from dynamoDB
- Use this [schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema) for customising your resume.
- Resume api endpoint: [get-my-resume](https://6gbptkzmz3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/resume)

## ü•á GCP Solution

Finally after a bit of delay, I have implemented the GCP solution for this challenge.

I wanted to implement multi-cloud solution to learn another cloud provider by transferring knowledge which I have already gained with AWS and to know the pros and cons of GCP and AWS.

- The way I implemented the solution for this challenge is by setting up an HTTP public GCP Cloud function using node.js which will fetch the data from Firestore
- We have to create a service account with very minimal permissions to make Cloud Function communicate with Cloud Firestore DB; the following are the permissions to accomplish the task:
  ```txt
  Cloud Functions Admin
  Cloud Run Invoker
  Firebase Admin
  ```
- Make sure you provide only `read-only-access` for the Firestore DB to avoid public write access
```JavaScript
  rules_version = '2';
  service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false;
    }
  }
 }  
```
- Users can access the Cloud Function with the functions URL: [get-my-resume](https://us-central1-lively-encoder-427806-d3.cloudfunctions.net/cloud-resume)
- Use this [schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema) for customising your resume.
